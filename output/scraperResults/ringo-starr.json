During his 8 years with The Beatles, Starr seemed to go with the flow, joining the band in India and studying under Hindu yogi Maharishi Maresh, but he (and John Lennon) weren't as into it as the other two, particularly George Harrison. Ringo was actually the first Beatle to leave the Maharishi sessions and rejected the yogi's Transcendental Meditation."

In fact, it's incredibly surprising how little he has had to say about political issues. His calling-card saying is \"Peace and Love\" with an outstretched, two-finger peace sign, channeling the political ideals of the 1960's. We can assume, I suppose, that he's a hippie at heart, complete with the libertarian ideology of \"Live and Let Live,\" free-love and drugs."
